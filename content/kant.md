记录一些康德哲学。

The philosopher Immanuel Kant said that rational human beings should be treated as an end in themselves and not as a means to something else. The fact that we are human has value in itself.

哲学家伊曼纽尔康德说，理性的人应该被视为目的本身，而不是达到其他目的的手段。我们是人这一事实本身就具有价值。

If a person is an end-in-themself it means their inherent value doesn't depend on anything else - it doesn't depend on whether the person is enjoying their life, or making other people's lives better. We exist, so we have value.

如果一个人以自己为目的，这意味着他们的内在价值不依赖于任何其他东西——它不依赖于这个人是否在享受他们的生活，或者是否让其他人的生活变得更好。我们存在，所以我们有价值。
