>
> Why don't people think their food farmed by marginalized migrant farm workers under near-slavery conditions is exploitative?
>
> 为什么人们不认为他们在近乎奴役的条件下被边缘化的移民农场工人养殖的食物是剥削性的？
> Why do people drive electric cars and carry cell phones who's batteries' minerals were literally mined by slave laborers?
>
> 为什么人们开电动车，带手机，电池里的矿物质实际上是由奴隶劳工开采的？
> Why do people still buy chocolate, and why do rich people waste it in sculptures, despite it being notorious for child slavery.

有用户回复：

> You absolutely have a point, and I'm not trying to argue with you at all, but i guess it's a little easier to "ignore" where the clothes that show up in your mailbox come from than the folks getting whipped while picking cotton in your front yard.
>
> 你绝对有道理，我一点也不想和你争论，但我想"忽略"你邮箱里出现的衣服来自哪里比在你前院摘棉花时被鞭打的人更容易。

层主回复：

> A vast majority of whites (in america) during the slavery era didn't own slaves. They ignored slavery in the exact same way we ignore it today. It's very easy to turn a blind eye when you benefit from it.
>
> 奴隶制时代的绝大多数白人（在美国）没有奴隶，他们无视奴隶制的方式和我们今天无视奴隶制的方式一模一样，当你从中受益时，很容易视而不见。

另一位用户回楼上：

> 30.8 percent of the free families in the confederacy owned slaves. source
> 邦联中 30.8%的自由家庭拥有奴隶

然后我成功的困惑了。
